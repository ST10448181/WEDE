<p align=left>I have been Instructed to investigate the findings of drone technology on urban planning and in order to do that we have to investigate the topic. Drones use use UAV technology to perform potentially dangerous tasks. unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is an aircraft without any human pilot, crew, or passengers on board
This investigation will be focusing on understanding the concept of drone technology on the urban panning environment and its impact on cityscapes, urban houses, real estate etc. During this task, I will be constructing information regarding drone technology in the urban planning in order to broaden the understanding of this concept and what it involves.
</p>

<p align=left>This assessment's research was done using a variety of online resources, including articles, websites, and videos. In order to learn more about the use of drones in urban planning, which is the subject of our inquiry, we also used questionnaires.</p>
